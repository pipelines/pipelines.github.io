Inspired by Michael Barton's [nucleotid.es](http://nucleotid.es).\r\n\r\nDockerfiles can be found on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/pipelines/). Automated docker container builds at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/pipelines/). Documentation at ReadTheDocs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nSome of the initial concepts were nutted out at [AMIGOS 2015](http://theamigos.space). The idea to compare the results of the \"Australian\" microbial genomics pipelines was pitched by Jason Kwong.\r\n\r\nThe following representatives from pipeline development teams joined Jason -\r\n* Melinda Ashcroft ([Banzai](https://github.com/mscook/Banzai-MicrobialGenomics-Pipeline))\r\n* Mark Davies (Sanger)\r\n* David Edwards ([RedDog](https://github.com/katholt/RedDog))\r\n* Jason Kwong ([nullarbor](https://github.com/tseemann/nullarbor))\r\n* Derek Sarovich ([SPANDx](https://github.com/dsarov/SPANDx))\r\n\r\nMitchell Stanton-Cook donated his beloved pipelin.es domain to the cause.\r\n\r\nMitchell Stanton-Cook is the core maintainer.\r\n\r\n### Mailing list\r\n\r\n[Sign up here](http://pipelin.es/list.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
